What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

* Git Workflow was a tough concept to wrap my head around. I understand why it's necessary and the importance of version control, but without much practice it's hard to get good at.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

* Pull requests were a concept that I had trouble with. In theory alone, I was having trouble visualizing how Git and GitHub work together. Actually getting to practice working on my local machine and then merging to the repo on GitHub via Pull Requests really cleared that up for me.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

* I remember not knowing the ```git fetch``` command, having instead always used ```git pull``` to update the repo on my local machine.

What still confuses you about Git?

* I know there's still a lot to learn with Git. I need to practice with it in order to get better at using it. Just reading about Git and using it once or twice isn't enough to become an expert. Sometimes I get confused when I update my repo and get a message like ```Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 4 commits.```

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

* Overall, very good. We helped each other a lot. When we got stuck, we were able to talk through the problem, or have an instructor available to assist.
