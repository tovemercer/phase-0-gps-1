What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
the push/pull requests between git and github are a little confusing to me. remembering the git commands to pull and push as well as update your local termianl after someone else has made chages is still a little comfusing.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
i feel like i have a better understanding of the pull/push process since pairing. watching someone else work was more helpful than i thought it would be. also, our guide explained git fetch and git merge really well. i have a pretty good understanding of that now.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
our guide definitly cleared up some confusion both pat and i had on git fetch and git merge. i was unclear on git checkout and pat was able to explain what it is and how it is used really well. 

What still confuses you about Git?
some of the cammands. i think i just need to get a little more familiar with them. trying to recall the information tonight was harder than i would like it to be. getting in git and github and playing around a little would help me with that.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
it was good! better than i expected honestly. i thought i would feel really overwhelmed working with someone but pat was nice and i thought we communicated well. the whole process was pretty smooth and we got the work done shortly after the guide left.
